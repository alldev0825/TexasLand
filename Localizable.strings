"About Us Q" = "Mellow is a state of mind, a culture, a way of being. Our mission is to provide delicious food in a fun and creative environment. We are the originators of Classic Southern Pizza, and our uniqueand flavorful crust is a true original. We began from humble roots, born out of the free-wheelin’ hippy culture of the 1970’s. The idea back then was the same as it is now, to make the most delicious, craveable slice of pizza on the planet. The MellowMushroom founders dreamed of a world where happiness could be found in the simplest things; like a mouthwatering slice of pizza and an ice cold beer.";
